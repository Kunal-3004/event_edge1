### PS Description :
<b>Background:</b> Event organizers lack real-time visibility into their ticket sales, audience demographics, and revenue streams, leading to inefficient marketing strategies and missed revenue opportunities. Many rely on static reports, third-party ticketing platforms, or spreadsheets, making it difficult to make data-driven decisions on the go.

<b>Common issues include:</b>
1) No live ticket sales tracking, leading to uncertainty about event demand.

2) Difficulty identifying marketing effectiveness, resulting in wasted ad spend.
   
3) Lack of insights into attendee demographics and purchase patterns.

4) Inability to react quickly to low sales trends, causing revenue loss.

<b>Objective:</b> To develop a mobile app (Android & iOS) that provides real-time ticket sales tracking, audience analytics, and actionable recommendations to event organizers.


<b>Summary:</b>
We developed a mobile-first application that empowers event organizers with real-time visibility into ticket sales, audience demographics, revenue streams, and marketing performance. The app addresses the common pain points of relying on static reports or third-party tools by offering live dashboards, sales tracking, and actionable insights on the go. This enables organizers to make data-driven decisions instantly, optimize ad spend, respond proactively to sales trends, and maximize event success.

### Objectives :
1. Make it easy for the event organisers to create live events and sell tickets.
2. Make it easy for the event organisers to track their events sales systematically and nicely by graphical representation.
3. Have a record of the past events for analysis and improvements for further events
4. Have a user friendly interface for the organisers
5. Interactive chat bot feature in case the user wants someone to talk with when no one is around.
6. A feature to connect all the users together at real-time and they can have a conversation among themselves. This will improve their communication skills and can provide them recreational time with some new friends.
7. An option to even connect with a VoCo Expert to clear course related doubts and any queries they might have.
8. Fun and interactive games section to improve their mental ability and train their mind.
9. To improve the UI for more easy usability for the visually impaired people.
